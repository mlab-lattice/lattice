# Overview

This documentation attempts to give an overview of the architecture of lattice, and this `README` should be used as the entrypoint to the documentation.

These documents do not attempt to explain what lattice is or how to use it, but instead how lattice is built and operates.

A working understanding of the user-facing concepts of lattice will be assumed, as will familiarity with `golang`.

# API

Documentation on the design of the API can be found in [api.md](api.md).

# System Definitions

Documentation on system definitions and the components implementing it can be found in [system-definition.md](definition-language.md).
